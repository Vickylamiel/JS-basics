6. Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming language are two different typing systems used in programming. The main difference between them is how the type of a variable is determined.
Statically typed languages are those in which the type of a variable must be declared when it's created and can't be changed later on. Examples include : Java, C++, C#, Swift.
While Dynamically typed languages determine the type of a variable at runtime, during the execution of the code. In these languages, variables don't have atype specified when they are created and the type of a variable can change dynamically during the course of the program. Examples include : JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl.
